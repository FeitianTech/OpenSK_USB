### Caution

You should read the following notes before you try or buy our OpenSK dongle.

1. Please keep in mind that OpenSK is a research platform, Google hopes it is used by researchers, security key manufacturers, and enthusiasts to help develop innovative features and accelerate security key adoption. Feitian OpenSK dongle is manufactured for researchers or enthusiasts to learn what FIDO is and how it works. It is not intended to be used for the circumstance that needs highest security.  

2. The core nRF52840 chip is just a **microcontroller** instead of a **secure element**, so this OpenSK dongle may not resist some advanced hardware and physical attacks. It is not much safe to protect your personal online account and secret data as other Feitian FIDO security keys can do. So if you are a government officer, journalist, activist, or someone else at risk of targeted online attacks and need deeply secure protection, we recommend you to use our commercial [Feitian FIDO security keys](https://www.ftsafe.com/Products/FIDO).  

3. Except for some advanced hardware and physical attacks, OpenSK is still a better choice to protect your online account remotely. If you want to use it to protect your personal data, please keep it safe and do not provide it to any other one wittingly or involuntarily.
