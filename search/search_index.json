It is a fully open-source FIDO security key implementation, include hardware and software. In that announcement , Google said By opening up OpenSK as a research platform, our hope is that it will be used by researchers, security key manufacturers, and enthusiasts to help develop innovative features and accelerate security key adoption. The firmware of OpenSK is developed in Rust and it implements both FIDO U2F and FIDO2 specifications . These specifications are released by FIDO Alliance , which is an open industry association with a focused mission: authentication standards to help reduce the world\u2019s over-reliance on passwords. FEITIAN is the Board Member. To help and accelerate FIDO security key adoption, FEITIAN improves the housing and makes new designs of OpenSK USB Dongle, removes unused PCB components, public the design. Users can build firmware from the source code of Google OpenSK Github repository without changing anything, provision it to this OpenSK hardware, to experience and try FIDO authentications. Before you try to program firmware to OpenSK, please read the original OpenSK guide at first. The following documents are most like additional remarks. attention Before you try or buy Feitian OpenSK Dongle, please be sure that you have read the important caution message. OpenSK Model \u00b6 We have two models of OpenSK USB Dongle, V1 and V2. They are designed according to the nRF52840 USB dongle , which is used by Google OpenSK firmware. The difference between V1 and V2 is the method to enter bootloader mode. To OpenSK V1, user should insert a paper clip or a SIM-eject tool to the RESET button hole to enter bootloader mode. This is similar to user push the RESET button on the nRF52840 USB dongle. To OpenSK V2, after user connects the device to a computer, he should push and hold on to the user button for more than 10 seconds, then OpenSK will be in bootloader mode. For detailed information, please refer to the hardware description page . Programming firmware \u00b6 1. Pre-requisite \u00b6 The OpenSK USB Dongle V1 or V2. Before you program the firmware to OpenSK USB Dongle, you should switch it to bootloader mode. Please refer to the Hardware Page to learn how to switch OpenSK to bootloader mode. You can check to make sure it is in bootloader according to this section . Read the Original OpenSK guide. Before you perform the following operations, please read OpenSK and its installation guide to learn how to customize your security key, for example, to change the signature counter mechanism and Attestation Certificate. Install nrfutil tool. This tool allows you to directly flash firmware to OpenSK over USB without additional hardware. 2. Development Environment and configuration \u00b6 Prepare a Development environment. You should prepare a Development environment by yourself according to this section . The scripts provided in this project have been tested under Linux and macOS . We haven't tested them on Windows and other platforms. Clone Google OpenSK Github repository . $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/OpenSK.git Initial setup. If you just cloned this repository, you need to run the following script: $ ./setup.sh For more information, please refer to the Initial setup . Configure the OpenSK security parameter. Please follow the description to change the Attestation Certificate as you want. If you are not familiar with OpenSK and FIDO, we recommend you do not change anything. 3. Flashing the firmware \u00b6 Although you can download the firmware to our OpenSK V1 and V2 by using J-LINK as described in OpenSK installation guide , we recommend you program the firmware through the USB interface, it is more convenient. Switch OpenSK to bootloader mode. Please refer to OpenSK Model or hardware page to learn how to switch OpenSK to bootloader mode. The LEDs show different behavior in different mode. Please refer to the hardware page to see LED status of OpenSK V1 and V2. Program the OpenSK USB dongle. NOTE If your dongle can not work well, please refer to https://github.com/google/OpenSK/pull/247 to erase the storage at first and then flash the firmware to try. (--erase_storage only works in develop branch instead of stable branch currently) ./deploy.py --board=nrf52840_dongle_dfu --erase_storage --programmer=nordicdfu After this command, you should switch your OpenSK to bootloader mode again to perform following operations. $ ./deploy.py --board=nrf52840_dongle_dfu --opensk --programmer=nordicdfu When prompt Press [ENTER] when ready. Just press Enter, the firmware will be flashed to your OpenSK USB Dongle. When the progress bar reaches 100%, OpenSK USB Dongle will be in working mode automatically. Please provision Attestation Certificate and Private Key before you test your OpenSK. 4. Configure Attestation Certificate and Private Key \u00b6 You need to inject the cryptographic material if you enabled batch attestation or CTAP1/U2F compatibility (which is the case by default), otherwise, it can not work well. ./tools/configure.py \\ --certificate=crypto_data/opensk_cert.pem \\ --private-key=crypto_data/opensk.key Now you can test your OpenSK. Test FIDO functions \u00b6 Please refer to Test Page .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"#welcome-to-feitian-opensk-usb-dongle","text":"OpenSK was announced by Google on January 30, 2020.

They have almost same schematic but different casing. Currently, only V2 is available to the market. OpenSK V2 \u00b6 It has a metal housing with only one button in the aft area. NOTE The LED and User button are together. The button material is transparent, so user can see LED light through the button. Since the LED is behind the button, you have to check it from the aft area to find it breathing or flashing. 1. Switch To bootloader mode \u00b6 After user connects the device to a computer, push and hold on the user button for more than 10 seconds and then release the button. If the red LED is breathing , OpenSK is in bootloader mode. 2. LED status \u00b6 LED behavior Mode type Trigger Method Red LED is breathing bootloader mode Connect OpenSK to USB port, press the user button for more than more than 10 seconds and then release the button Red LED is flashing bootloader mode Flash the firmware No LED on Working mode Idle R/G/B LED is flashing Working mode Wait for user presence when receiving FIDO command 3. Hardware \u00b6 The hardware schematic and PCB are shared here . OpenSK V1 \u00b6 It has a 3D-printed case with one user button and one RESET button. 1. Switch To bootloader mode \u00b6 After connecting OpenSK to the USB port, please insert a paper clip or a SIM-eject tool to the RESET button hole to switch it to bootloader mode. This is similar to user pushes the RESET button on the original nRF52840 USB dongle. NOTE The RESET button hole is covered by OpenSK label. So if you want to program the firmware occasionally, you can choose not to cover the label although we send the label to you together with OpenSK hardware. 2.

Hardware \u00b6 The hardware schematic and PCB files can be downloaded here . Check Bootloader Mode \u00b6 Sometimes, maybe you don't know whether your OpenSK is in bootloader mode after above operation, you can have three ways to check. 1. LED breathing \u00b6 If the red LED is breathing , OpenSK is in bootloader mode, this is the simplest way. 2. lsusb command \u00b6 On Linux or macOS, just run $ lsusb to see the result. (Plesae make sure you have this command installed previously.) If there is line similar to below message(1915:521f & Nordic & Open DFU Bootloader ) Bus 020 Device 026: ID 1915:521f Nordic Semiconductor ASA Open DFU Bootloader Serial: FFCCAE942A17 then it is in bootloader mode. Other message line without Open DFU Bootloader but include 1915:521f and Nordic means it is in normal working mode. 3.
